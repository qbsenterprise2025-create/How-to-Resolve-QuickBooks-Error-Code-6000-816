How to Resolve QuickBooks Error Code 6000, 816 – Description

QuickBooks Error Code 6000, 816 usually appears when a company file (.QBW) is damaged, inaccessible, or being used by multiple workstations simultaneously. This error prevents users from opening the company file and often indicates issues related to file corruption, insufficient folder permissions, hosting conflicts, or system/network restrictions. Understanding the possible reasons and the right troubleshooting steps helps restore access and resume operations smoothly.

Causes of QuickBooks Error 6000, 816

This error generally occurs due to:

Damaged or corrupted company file (.QBW)

Incorrect hosting settings across multiple systems

Insufficient folder or file permissions for the location where the company file is stored

Conflicts with firewall or security applications

Multiple users attempting to open the same file at the same time

Incomplete QuickBooks installation or missing program components

Network setup issues that block multi-user access

How to Fix QuickBooks Error 6000, 816
1. Use QuickBooks File Doctor Tool

Running the QuickBooks File Doctor helps automatically identify and repair company file damage and network issues.

Download and install QuickBooks Tool Hub

Open Company File Issues section

Run QuickBooks File Doctor

Select the affected company file and allow the repair to complete

2. Verify Hosting Settings

Incorrect hosting across systems triggers 6000-series errors.

On every workstation:

Open QuickBooks

Go to File > Utilities

Ensure “Host Multi-User Access” is the only option enabled on the server computer

Workstations must show “Stop Hosting Multi-User Access” (they should NOT host)

3. Check Folder Permissions

Make sure that the folder containing the company file allows full access:

Right-click the folder containing the .QBW file

Select Properties > Security

Grant Full Control to all QuickBooks users

Improper permissions often block QuickBooks from opening the file.

4. Rename .ND and .TLG Files

These configuration files may become damaged.

Open the folder containing the QBW file

Locate .ND and .TLG files

Rename both by adding .old at the end

QuickBooks auto-creates fresh versions when you reopen the company file.

5. Move the Company File to a Local Folder

To rule out network path issues:

Copy the company file (.QBW) to Desktop or C:\Local Drive

Attempt to open it from this new location

If it opens normally, the issue lies with network or folder permissions

6. Configure Firewall and Security Settings

Unconfigured firewall rules can block QuickBooks access.

Allow QuickBooks ports and executable files through the firewall

Temporarily disable third-party antivirus software if necessary

Reopen QuickBooks and try accessing the file

7. Recreate the Damaged Company File (If Required)

If corruption is severe:

Create a backup restore

Or use Auto Data Recovery (ADR)

Rebuild data using QuickBooks tools (File > Utilities > Rebuild Data)

8. Repair or Reinstall QuickBooks

If program files are corrupted:

Use QuickBooks Tool Hub > Program Problems

Run Quick Fix My Program

If unresolved, repair QuickBooks from Control Panel

As a last resort, perform a clean install
